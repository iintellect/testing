				<h3>Limited Presale Reopened </h3>
				<h4>By Aitheon Community Vote</h4>
				<div class="news-paragraph">
					<p>February 2, 2018 Las Vegas, Nevada –As some of you may know, during the FinCEN update on 1/30, syndicate buyers
						purchased the remaining token supply, which caused the presale to not re-open to the public.</p>

					<p>	As a result of our fervent commitment to the Aitheon community and our vision to grow our ecosystem by cultivating
						and connecting an expansive network of participants, we held a community vote to determine if a second round presale
						was in order.</p>

					<p>With the polls closing at an 87% vote yes, we have decided to extend the ICO Presale on a limited basis in order to allow more
						individuals the opportunity to participate in this exciting phase of our project. Although we value our Institutional partners,
						we made this decision based upon the overwhelming response from our community who requested an extension to the Presale and to avoid
						concentrating a large number of tokens into the hands of few.</p>

					<p>We will be conducting the presale in the following fashion:</p>

					<p>Cap 22,000,000 Tokens (3,850,000 USD). These are tokens were escrowed by institutional partners,
						we have found other ways to work with them and took these back for the community to buy. This will not have
						an impact on the hard cap. This was also the best middle ground for everyone to be happy.</p>

					<p>Per person cap will be 126,000 Tokens (~25 ETH right now)</p>

					<p>The Presale will resume on Saturday, February 3th at 11 am PST. The duration will be 72hrs</p>
